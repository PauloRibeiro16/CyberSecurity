# WI-FI

AP This is the access point, or the place where the clients connect to the WiFi and get Internet access.
PSK - Pre-Shared-Key: this is the password used to authenticate to the AP
SSID - The name used to identify the AP
ESSID - Extended Service Set Identifier: same as the SSID but can be used for
multiple APs in a wireless LAN
BSSID - Basic Service Set Identifier: this is the unique identifier for every AP.
Itâ€™s the same as the MAC address of the AP.
Channels - Wi-Fi operates on channels 1-14 but is limited to 1-11 in the United
States.
Power - The closer you are to the AP, the stronger the signal. The signal in the
United States is limited to .5 watts by the FCC
Security - This the security protocol to authenticate and encrypt Wi-Fi traffic. The
most popular at this time is WPA-PSK
