# Compiling Windows Exploits

1. To begin with, we must ensure that our Kali Linux VM has all the necessary build
tools required for compiling Windows binaries. This can be done by running the
following command:
    
    ```
           sudo apt install mingw-w64
    
    ```
    
2. You will now need to download the exploit code to the Kali VM. This can either be
done directly or through the wget utility as follows:
3. We can now begin the compilation process, however, based on the target system's
architecture, we will need to compile the source code differently.
    
    For x64-based operating systems, run the following command, and substitute the
    parameters with your own files and output names:
    
    ```
           i686-w64-mingw32-gcc exploit.c -o exploit.exe
    
    ```
    
    If the target is a 32-bit system, run the following command:
    
    ```
           i686-w64-mingw32-gcc exploit.c -o exploit.exe -lws2_32
    
    ```
    

This will compile the exploit into a binary that we can then transfer over to our target to
be executed.
